# Project Change Log — 2026-01-05

## Major Features & Components Added

### Journal Details Page Overhaul
- **New JournalDetails page** at `/journals/[id]` using:
  - `JournalDetails` main component
  - `JournalProfileCard` for journal info
  - `JournalSidebarNav` for sticky accordion navigation
  - `ProfileTabs` with dropdown support for "Articles and Issues"
  - Dynamic tab content: Overview, Editorial Board, Articles & Issues (with dropdown: Latest Issues, All Issues, Linked Datasets), Stats, Contact
- **Data-driven architecture**: All overview content and sidebar sections are generated from a single `journalData` object (see `data.ts`).
- **Conditional rendering**: All sections and subsections in the overview use `&&` operator for future CMS/dynamic field support.

### New Components
- `ContactTab`: Journal contact, editorial, and publisher details (matches UI in provided screenshot)
- `LatestIssuesTab`: Fully matches provided screenshot, including:
  - Left sidebar filter accordion (Access Type, Publication Type, Years, Categories, Languages)
  - Latest Issue header (Volume, Date, navigation buttons)
  - Search bar, pagination, and article cards (using ArticleListView pattern)
- `JournalSidebarNav`: Accordion navigation with anchor links for all overview sections
- `ProfileTabs`: Now supports dropdown tabs (with `dropdown` property in tab definition)

### TypeScript & Data Structure
- `JournalContent` interface in `data.ts` for all journal overview fields (future-proof for CMS)
- All content for overview, ethics, writing, etc. is now in a single data object
- Sidebar and overview sections are generated dynamically from this data

## UI/UX Improvements
- **ProfileTabs**: Dropdown support for tabs (e.g., "Articles and Issues" with Latest Issues, All Issues, Linked Datasets)
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Accordion with anchor links, sticky on scroll
- **Article Cards**: Unified design for articles in Latest Issues, using ArticleListView structure
- **ContactTab**: Matches provided screenshot for contact/editorial/publisher info

## Refactoring & Bug Fixes
- Removed all hardcoded overview content from JournalOverviewTab; now 100% data-driven
- Cleaned up duplicate/legacy code in JournalOverviewTab (file reduced from 1171 to 671 lines)
- Added missing closing brackets and fixed all TypeScript errors
- Updated exports in TabDetails/index.ts to include all new tab components
- Updated JournalDetails to use new ContactTab

## Other Changes
- Updated `app/(general)/journals/[id]/page.tsx` to use new JournalDetails and Container/Breadcrumb
- Minor style and prop fixes in shared components (Header, Card, CategoryFilter, etc.)
- Updated types for journals and profile tabs
- Cleaned up and removed old docs: QUICKSTART.md, SETUP_SUMMARY.md
